Inception Assignment

This is a repo design to practice making changes to a project, committing and then pushing the project to Github.  The 
assignment was based on the movie Inception where you would move the text files (persons) down to the next dream (sub-folder)
and then commit.  This would be done to mimic the dream sequence at the end of the movie.
